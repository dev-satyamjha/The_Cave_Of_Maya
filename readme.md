# The Cave of Maya

**The Cave of Maya** is a 7-level psychological puzzle game that traps a proud man named Santosh in a mystical cave born from his own anger, greed, and lust.

To escape these illusions, you must navigate a deep, branching storyline that seamlessly weaves modern psychological struggles with ancient Indian philosophy. As you descend deeper into the cave, you will face mind-bending puzzles, complex riddles hidden entirely within the dialogue, and advanced ciphering techniques to break the deceptive traps blocking your path. 

Failing a trial doesn't just reset your progress; it violently throws you into disorienting, timed "Strange Places" where the lack of rules is the ultimate test of your survival. 

## Key Features

* **7 Stages of Illusion:** Progress through challenging levels that manifest the human flaws of *Krodha* (Anger), *Lobha* (Greed), and *Moha* (Lust).
* **Narrative-Driven Puzzles:** The answers aren't in your inventory—they are in the conversations. Read carefully, as clues to ciphers and riddles are hidden entirely within the dialogue.
* **The "Strange Places" Mechanic:** A high-stakes punishment system. Failing a puzzle drops you into chaotic, timed survival rooms where the normal rules of the game no longer apply.
* **Ancient Lore:** Deeply inspired by Hindu philosophy and ancient epics, blending historical facts with psychological introspection.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Built to be accessible, offering a seamless gameplay experience across Web, Windows, and Linux operating systems.
